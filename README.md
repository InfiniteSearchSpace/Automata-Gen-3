Automata-Gen-3
==============
This is my full Eclipse workspace folder, plus runnable jar.

Setup:

- Run program from included jar, or through Eclipse by selecting the "Automata-Gen-3-master/workspace" folder on program start. You could also import the included source to another IDE.

- Once running, click & drag window frame a little (for mouse location)

==============

Basic Use:

- Left click to set the value of cells according to selected Tool. This is typically 0 or 1, though some rules use other negative and positive values.

- Right click to toggle Play/Pause.

- Scroll Wheel will cycle through the selected MouseWheel menu item. The default is "Tool Subfunction", where scrolling changes the type of block to place.

==============

Colour Scheme & Graphics:

- Cells are one pixel each. I reccomend using 'magnifier' on windows or 'KMag' on linux when viewing.

- When the maximum value of all cells is 1, all cells of value 1 are black.

- When the maximum value is larger than one, value 1 is light blue, low numbers are whiter, higher numbers are blacker in a greyscale gradient

- Negative numbers range from red to yellow
